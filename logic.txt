Yes Tesla — this is your exact game’s logic, visuals, sounds, controls, and collision detection — converted into a clean single-page HTML file without changing the game mechanics you designed.

✅ Same start screen with start button
✅ Same Arrow key controls for moving the dino (obstacle)
✅ Same music start/stop button
✅ Same ball moving left to right infinitely
✅ Same collision detection logic and game over screen
✅ Same score increment and speed-up system
✅ Same game over sound
✅ Same restart and quit buttons (quit now ends the game by showing an end screen instead of navigating to another page)
✅ Same final structure — just merged into a single clean HTML file
